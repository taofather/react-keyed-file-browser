    <h1>Live Demo</h1>
  </div>
  <p>To participate in the demonstration you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript enabled</li>
    <li>A modern browser</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All examples given are written with babel loaders to support es6 (stage-0) and JSX syntax.</p>

  <h2>Simple Flat &amp; Read-Only Example</h2>
  <p>This example demonstrates read-only use of the browser, with a flat list of files (the keys do
  not contain any forward slashes so no folders are drawn).</p>
  <div class="demo-mount-flat-simple"></div>
  <code
    class="script"
    data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/flat-simple.js"
  >Loading ...</code>

  <h2>Nested Table with Event Handlers</h2>
  <p>In this example, the files are contained within common folders as indicated by the forward
  slash in the file keys.</p>
  <p>Simple event handlers are also provided as props to the browser, which allow it to respond to
  actions on the files. The presence of these handlers enables the buttons and/or the drag &amp;
  drop responsiveness.</p>
  <p>This example is not connected to any file storage backend; it simply takes all changes made by
  the user and assumes that they would have been successful.</p>
  <div class="demo-mount-nested-editable"></div>
  <code
    class="script"
    data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/nested-editable.js"
  >Loading ...</code>

  <h2>Different Renderers and Groupers</h2>
  <p>In this example, the files and folder renderers have been replaced with Thumbnail renderers.
  Files are grouped by their month modified rather than their keyed folder structure.</p>
  <div class="demo-mount-grouped-thumbnails"></div>
  <code
    class="script"
    data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/grouped-thumbnails.js"
  >Loading ...</code>
</div>
